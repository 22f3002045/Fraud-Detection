A machine learning approach to detect fraudulent financial transactions with high accuracy and minimal false alarms.

## üîç The Problem

In the financial world, fraudulent transactions cost institutions billions every year. Traditional rule-based systems struggle to keep up with evolving fraud tactics. This project creates a robust machine learning solution that:

- Detects 99.57% of fraudulent transactions
- Generates zero false positives
- Identifies key patterns that indicate fraud
- Provides actionable insights for fraud prevention

## üìä The Dataset

The dataset contains millions of financial transactions with the following characteristics:
- 6,362,620 transactions
- 10 columns of transaction data
- Only 0.129% fraudulent transactions (extreme class imbalance)
- Transaction types include CASH_IN, CASH_OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, and TRANSFER

Key attributes in the data:
- Transaction amount
- Origin and destination account balances (before and after)
- Transaction type
- Step (time unit)

The dataset file is included in this repository.

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach

### Feature Engineering

I created custom features that significantly improved fraud detection:
- Balance difference calculations
- Transaction amount relative to account balance
- Balance error detection
- Zero balance indicators
- Transaction pattern identification

### Model Selection

After testing multiple algorithms, the Random Forest classifier emerged as the top performer, although XGBoost and CatBoost showed similar excellent results. The model was trained on a carefully balanced dataset with a 60:1 ratio of legitimate to fraudulent transactions.

### Key Finding

One of the most revealing discoveries: **transactions that leave accounts with zero balances** are strongly indicative of fraud. This pattern, along with balance inconsistencies, forms the backbone of the detection system.

## üìà Results

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | ROC-AUC |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Random Forest | 0.99993 | 1.00000 | 0.99574 | 0.99787 |
| XGBoost | 0.99991 | 0.99939 | 0.99513 | 0.99756 |
| CatBoost | 0.99992 | 1.00000 | 0.99513 | 0.99757 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.96643 | 0.32592 | 0.98052 | 0.97336 |
| LightGBM | 0.99036 | 0.64509 | 0.91601 | 0.95380 |

Confusion Matrix for Random Forest:
```
[[98556     0]
 [    7  1636]]
```

This means:
- 98,556 legitimate transactions correctly identified
- 1,636 fraudulent transactions caught
- 7 fraudulent transactions missed
- 0 legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged as fraud

## üîë Top Fraud Indicators

The most important features for detecting fraud:

1. Balance inconsistencies (20.5%)
2. Original balance changes (17.9%)
3. Transaction amount relative to balance (14.2%)
4. New original balance (11.2%)
5. Zero balance after transaction (7.4%)
